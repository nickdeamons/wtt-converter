/* Tim Davis	There are several things that make The UPS Store exceptional.	0:00:00	0:07:00
Tim Davis	First is it's a proven business model that's been working over 35 years.	0:07:00	0:14:00
Tim Davis	Secondly, we have the power of the UPS brand, a world recognized, world class brand. 	0:14:00	0:20:00
Micehlle Van-Slyke	It is a brand that has a great deal of strength in the marketplace, a wonderful reputation,	0:20:00	0:25:00
Micehlle Van-Slyke	so virtually the minute you open your doors you have visibility in the market place. 	0:25:00	0:30:00
Chris Adkins	The strength of this brand and the shield we carry on our sign is one of the most recognizable brands in the world.	0:30:npm install 00	0:35:00
Chris Adkins	And I think that attracts a lot of people to the brand just because of that.	0:35:00	0:38:00
Micehlle Van-Slyke	There are several key factors that really distinguished The UPS Store from other business or other franchises that someone can purchase 	0:38:00	0:46:00
Micehlle Van-Slyke	Um, the best part really is that you get to be that independent business owner,	0:46:00	0:50:00
Micehlle Van-Slyke	which is what attracts people to franchising in the first place. However with The UPS Store	0:50:00	0:56:00
Micehlle Van-Slyke	we offer a really comprehensive program and you also get the backing of all of our resources, 	0:56:00	1:02:00
John & Marie McKinney	We joined the ups network after doing research around a lot of different brands and the UPS really had what	1:02:00	1:09:00
John & Marie McKinney	we were looking for with our priorities of having a better quality of life and work life balance is something 	1:09:00	1:15:00
John & Marie McKinney	that we can do together as a family um, we knew we wanted a brand that was strong and reputable and 	1:15:00	1:22:00
John & Marie McKinney	be proud of and be apart of and um, we wanted a small team um that we could work with, and of course we wanted a good return on our investment 	1:22:00	1:29:00
John & Marie McKinney	and UPS really fit all the objectives that we were looking for and going into business for ourselves  	1:29:00	1:35:00
Tim Davis	The gap The UPS Store fills in the market place is that we are a full service one stop shop for small businesses customers.	1:35:00	1:42:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	Small business owners need help and support with their business which we clearly provide,	1:42:00	1:47:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	it doesn't matter if we're providing a real street address with a mailbox or providing printing services. 	1:47:00	1:52:00
Tim Davis	Another item that makes The UPS Store exceptional is that our owners work this business from their heart.	1:52:00	1:59:00
Tim Davis	They're involved in their communities. We support the Toys for Tots literacy program with them on a	1:59:00	2:05:00
Tim Davis	national basis and our stores individually support local community charities and events all over the country. 	2:05:00	2:10:00
Heidi Morris 	 I feel that this franchise is so successful because of the UPS brand and what it tells our customers	2:10:00	2:17:00
Heidi Morris 	and what type of service they are going to get with in the store the other part that makes our franchise	2:17:00	2:23:00
Heidi Morris 	so successful are the people that own the franchises.  it's not a corporate it's that person's livelihood	2:23:00	2:30:00
Heidi Morris 	it's their families, it's their passion and that comes through in how we treat our customers and then	2:30:00	2:35:00
Heidi Morris 	the service that they get when they walk into our store 	2:35:00	2:36:00
Jim Hillquist	Our corporate philosophy is that you're not alone- and we believe that we need to support our	2:36:00	2:43:00
Jim Hillquist	franchisees because when they're succesful, we're successful. You know we've been in this business for a long time, 	2:43:00	2:51:00
Jim Hillquist	30+ years, and we know a lot of things that a lot of franchisees doesn't. We want to share	2:51:00	2:56:00
Jim Hillquist	that information, we want to give everybody an opportunity to be successful, and that's why we say 	2:56:00	3:01:00
Jim Hillquist	you're not alone because we're in there with you to try to make the best we can out of your store. 	3:01:00	3:07:00
Paul Erchinger 	There are several things that I think makes The UPS Store so successful. 	3:07:00	3:12:00
Paul Erchinger 	Probably first among them in my mind is one of the reasons I was drawn to this business in the first place, 	3:12:00	3:19:00
Paul Erchinger 	and that's the brand identity, the UPS logo, the respect, uh that goes along with that. Uh, secondly, 	3:19:00	3:28:00
Paul Erchinger 	is the great support that as an owner I get from the corporate headquarters, I get everything from	3:28:00	3:35:00
Paul Erchinger 	training to advertising and marketing, from purchasing, I just feel like every need I might have there	3:35:00	3:41:00
Paul Erchinger 	 is someone to call or email if I need that support	3:41:00	3:45:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	The UPS Store model provides a lot of support and resources for our store owners,  	3:45:00	3:50:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	our franchisees. In the marketing arena we do it in a number of ways, um #1 we have national advertising 	3:50:00	3:56:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	we cover off from TV advertising to print, radio, certainly the digital space. Our number 1 goal is to drive customers into the stores everyday	3:56:00	4:07:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	Uh #2, we have co-ops, so we have cooperatives of our franchisees to do, I'll call it more community advertising, 	4:07:00	4:15:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	And #3, we have great resources so our store owners can do their own 	4:15:00	4:18:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	advertising on a local level. We have an online site where they can get um advertising materials 	4:18:00	4:25:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	and even if we don't have it, we're happy to make a custom material as well, so really a lot of	4:25:00	4:30:00
Michelle Van-Slyke	resources all intended to drive customers into our stores.  	4:30:00	4:34:00
Chris Adkins	The franchise opportunities is really what the franchise prospect wants it to be. The franchisee can come	4:34:00	4:39:00
Chris Adkins	into our network and own one store, or they can come into the network with the opportunity to own many stores. 	4:39:00	4:47:00
Kevin Foley	New franchisees get a comprehensive level training when they join the network. Included in that training is, 	4:47:00	4:55:00
Kevin Foley	web based trainings, or WBTs, experience in a store and then we also have a university in San Diego 	4:55:00	5:02:00
Kevin Foley	and of course you know all of the operational experience that goes along with it. 	5:02:00	5:12:00
Chris Adkins	The ideal candidate for a person that wants to enter The UPS Store franchise	5:12:00	5:16:00
Chris Adkins	as a small business owner is someone that loves working with people, and be able to follow a proven system. 	5:16:00	5:21:00
Chris Adkins	We love owners with an entreprenuerial spirit and we want franchise prospects to come to our business	5:21:00	5:28:00
Chris Adkins	and want to be able to be in business for themselves, but no by themselves. 	5:28:00	5:32:00
Ashwin Narayan  	Making money is great in this business, but the actual feeling for when, you get for helping	5:32:00	5:39:00
Ashwin Narayan  	a customer out is just very fulfilling. You know that you've helped someone succeed, passed on that 	5:39:00	5:45:00
Ashwin Narayan  	entreprenurial spirit to somebody, and uh, that's the greatest feeling in the world.	5:45:00	5:52:00 */
