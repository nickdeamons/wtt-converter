Laura Griffin: You never know who's going to walk through your door or what they are going to want. We recently had a customer

Laura Griffin: come in that was an older woman and she had a sketch that she wanted us to blow up for her. So we did.

Sandy Scandrett: we can do just about anything here. Small business, printing, shipping, packaging, shredding

Hamo Gharibian: I do not say no to any project. If the customer comes through the door even if I do not know how to do it, I say yes to it.

Greg Murray: the interesting thing about UPS Store is that when the customer walks to the door there's

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Greg Murray:  an extremely high probability that they're coming there to do something that is important to them.

Laura Griffin: she came back a few weeks later with any enormous painting to ship. And it was the painting

8
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Laura Griffin: that she had repainted from the sketch we had blown up. So it was cool to see

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Laura Griffin: the final finished product and we shipped it off for her 

10
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Sandy Scandrett: We, we do a really good job when it comes to packaging up items for customers. We treat it as if it was our own.

11
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Matthew Wood: When they bring an idea on a sheet of paper and then we can sit down and design and make the

12
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Matthew Wood: product for them and print it out and see the smile on their face brings satisfaction to me.

Joy Batchelor: I worked on the local restaurant for six months and their printer finally broke and 

14
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Joy Batchelor: they were printing their menus out. And they came to me just so they could use their own paper to print. 

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Joy Batchelor: And I quoted them on their exact paper and found out that I can actually get them their menus 

16
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Joy Batchelor: for a $1.75 cheaper than what they were doing right now on their own printer. 

17
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Joy Batchelor: And they were so excited that they can't wait to print with me forever now.

18
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Greg Murray: First thing is customer service. The other stuff is a positive side effect coming out of that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Matthew Wood: A print customer came into this store several years ago and asked us to serve 

20
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Matthew Wood: as a fulfilment center for them where we actually print and produce textbooks 

21
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Matthew Wood: and then ship them out individually to um, their customers all across the US and internationally. 

22
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Matthew Wood: That was satisfying for me because we are able to be the one stop solution for that particular customer.

23
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Joy Batchelor: What makes it worthwhile at the end of the day is the customers. The customers treat us like we're family.
