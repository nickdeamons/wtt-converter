Tim Davis: There are several things that make The UPS Store exceptional.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Tim Davis: First is it's a proven business model that's been working over 35 years.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Tim Davis: Secondly, we have the power of the UPS brand, a world recognized, world class brand. 

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Micehlle Van-Slyke: It is a brand that has a great deal of strength in the marketplace, a wonderful reputation,

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Micehlle Van-Slyke: so virtually the minute you open your doors you have visibility in the market place. 

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Chris Adkins: And I think that attracts a lot of people to the brand just because of that.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Micehlle Van-Slyke: There are several key factors that really distinguished The UPS Store from other business or other franchises that someone can purchase 

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Micehlle Van-Slyke: Um, the best part really is that you get to be that independent business owner,

10
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Micehlle Van-Slyke: which is what attracts people to franchising in the first place. However with The UPS Store

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Micehlle Van-Slyke: we offer a really comprehensive program and you also get the backing of all of our resources,

John & Marie McKinney: We joined the ups network after doing research around a lot of different brands and the UPS really had what

13
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
John & Marie McKinney: we were looking for with our priorities of having a better quality of life and work life balance is something 

14
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
John & Marie McKinney: that we can do together as a family um, we knew we wanted a brand that was strong and reputable and 

15
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
John & Marie McKinney: be proud of and be apart of and um, we wanted a small team um that we could work with, and of course we wanted a good return on our investment 

16
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
John & Marie McKinney: and UPS really fit all the objectives that we were looking for and going into business for ourselves  

17
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Tim Davis: The gap The UPS Store fills in the market place is that we are a full service one stop shop for small businesses customers.

20
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Tim Davis: Another item that makes The UPS Store exceptional is that our owners work this business from their heart.

22
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%

25
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%

34
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
Paul Erchinger : Probably first among them in my mind is one of the reasons I was drawn to this business in the first place, 

35
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000 line:-1 position:12% align:start size:75%
